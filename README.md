The article that I read highlights the fact computer programming is more about solving a problem than
programming languages itself. The author of the article writes about how he spent years studying programing languages
but in the end is overshadowed by a friend who knew less than half of what he did. The friend, instead of studying, focused his time on solving one specific problem and created a program that was bought by a big company.

**Disha Gupta (Comment):** I think it's interesting how this article discusses how it's not necessarily important to spend all of your time learning how to build things through programming but instead learning how to solve real world problems with programming. It offers a new perspective on how people in this field should approach the way they learn and/or work. The author of the article comes to realize that they may have spent too much time on learning how to do something in code and is now focusing on what he had to do for specific projects and understanding why it needed to be done.
